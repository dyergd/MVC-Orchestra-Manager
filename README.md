# MVC Orchestra Manager
 
This project is a used to manage orchestra. The user can create orchestras and add musicians and a conductor to it.

The data that this site uses is stored on a local database, as a result of that if the project is ran it will not work correctly.

This was the first major project created for my Advanced Web Design class my Senior year.
